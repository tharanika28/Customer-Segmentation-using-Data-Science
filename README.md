# Customer-Segmentation-using-Data-Science

## Project Description

Customer segmentation is a data-driven strategy that slices a customer base into discrete groups based on prevalent characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. This project seeks to use data science approaches to undertake customer segmentation, giving enterprises pertinent data for targeted marketing, personalized suggestions, and bespoke customer experiences.

## Project Objective

Improved Customer insight: Detect hidden trends and segmentation in the data to gain a better insight of your customer base.

Improved Marketing Strategies: Allow firms to generate more prosperous and tailored marketing efforts by emphasizingÂ certain customer segments.

Increased client Retention: Generate ways to increase customer devotion and retention through personalized experiences.

## Spyder Code Execution:

Spyder, a Python integrated development environment, was used to create and test this project. If you haven't already, you can install and configure Spyder on your machine by following the steps below:

#### STEP - 1: Install Anaconda
Anaconda, a Python and Spyder distribution, is recommended since it facilitates package management and environment setting. You can get Anaconda from the official website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install it according to your operating system's instructions.

#### STEP - 2: Launch Spyder
Once deploying Anaconda, you may run Spyder by opening the Anaconda Navigator or by typing "spyder" into the Anaconda Prompt.

#### STEP - 3: Launching and Executing the code
Navigate to File > Open Project and pick your project folder to open your project directory in Spyder. You can open the main script containing the code in the Spyder IDE. Simply press the "Run" button or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g., F5) while the code file is active to run it.
